// TestMaxBodyBytesConstantIsEnforced pins the actual cap New() wires into the
// public server's middleware chain.
//
// TestRequestBodyIsCapped in server_test.go only proves a POST to a GET-only
// route returns something other than 200 — true regardless of body size,
// since none of this service's routes read a request body (Phase 1 §7: every
// response but /locate comes from the in-memory snapshot; /locate reads query
// parameters, not the body). So the cap has no externally observable effect
// through the real route table, and a test built on those routes cannot pin
// it — it was found to still pass with maxBodyBytes set to 1<<40.
//
// The cap is only observable at the layer that enforces it: httpx.LimitBody
// wrapping the body in an http.MaxBytesReader. This test builds the SAME
// Chain construction New() uses, with the SAME maxBodyBytes constant, in
// front of a handler that actually reads the body — so a change to
// maxBodyBytes (including deleting it or setting it absurdly high) is exactly
// what this test pins.
