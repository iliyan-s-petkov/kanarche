// ParseCSV reads one archive CSV and aggregates it into hourly buckets.
// Unparseable rows are skipped rather than failing the file — an archive day

//
// Values are filtered to the same quality.InRange standard the live ingest
// path applies (internal/quality/score.go), and non-finite values are rejected
// outright. This deliberately supersedes task 13's brief, which specified no
// filtering here; that brief predates the whole-branch evidence below, and the
// unfiltered behaviour is the defect:
//
//   - strconv.ParseFloat accepts "nan", "NaN", "inf", "+Inf" and "Infinity",
//     so a non-finite cell is reachable from archive text. One such cell makes
//     the bucket's sum NaN, hence its avg NaN. min/max are worse: `value <
//     a.min` is false for NaN, so a NaN arriving first seeds both and no later
//     value can ever displace it.
//   - Postgres accepts NaN in `double precision NOT NULL`, so it stores
//     silently, and nothing ever rewrites a historical hourly bucket — the
//     live rollup only touches buckets at or after its watermark. A poisoned
//     row therefore persists for reading_hourly's full 2-year retention.
//   - encoding/json.Marshal returns UnsupportedValueError for NaN and Inf, so
//     in Phase 2 one poisoned row does not spoil one chart: it fails the
//     entire JSON response containing it, every time, until someone finds and
//     deletes the row by hand.
//   - Even setting NaN aside, an unfiltered −999 sentinel enters the
//     historical hourly mean and is then indistinguishable from a live-path
//     bucket built to the quality IN ('ok','no_neighbours') standard. No
//     column records which standard produced a row, so historical and live
//     buckets must be built to one standard or the difference is unknowable
//     after the fact.
//
// Filtering happens per value, not per row: a row whose humidity channel reads
// −999 still contributes its good P1 and P2 cells.
//
// qcfg supplies the plausibility ranges — the same config.Quality.Ranges the
// live ingest path scores against — so a range edited in airbg.yaml applies to
// both paths without a second, drifting copy of the bounds.
