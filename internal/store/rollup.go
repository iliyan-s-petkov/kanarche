// immediately before "current" is unconditionally reconciled on every call
// once the watermark has genuinely reached it (task-16 review finding 5):
// once the wall clock moves an hour forward, the loop above stops touching
// the hour that just ended, but readings for it can still arrive briefly
// afterwards (clock skew, delivery lag) — without this, the watermark would
// cement that hour as "done" while data kept trickling in. The reconcile
