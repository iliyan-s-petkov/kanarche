// In English an област is a province, never "oblast". Transliterating it leaves
// an English reader with a term they have to look up, on a page whose whole job
// is to be understood quickly — and the plural was worse: "oblasti" is not an
// English word at all.
//
// This is a rule about what appears ON SCREEN, so it checks the catalogue's
// values and deliberately not its keys. `col.oblast`, `data-oblast` and
// oblast-table.go are identifiers; renaming them would churn every reference to
// buy a reader nothing.
//
// Six strings breached this when the check was written — the map's tier line
// and five sentences on the about page. A regression here is easy to introduce
// and invisible to anyone reading only the Bulgarian.
