// CORS answers cross-origin reads of the JSON API for the origins a allows.
//
// Wrapped around the API mux rather than added to Chain, because the pages are
// not a cross-origin surface and a header set for everything is a header nobody
// can reason about. It sits INSIDE the chain, so a request refused by the rate
// limiter is refused before it gets here — a cross-origin caller lands on the
// same per-route bucket as any other, which is the point: this widens who may
// read the API, never how much of it they may read.
//
// No preflight handling. Every route is a GET with no custom request headers,
// which is a simple request — a browser sends it without asking first. An
// OPTIONS arriving here means something the API does not serve anyway.

		// Echoed byte for byte. A browser compares ACAO to the Origin it sent,
		// so any other allowed value is a refusal in disguise, and an absent
		// header is the unambiguous refusal.

// varyOnOrigin adds Origin to Vary as the response goes out, rather than
// before the handler runs.
//
// The ordering is the whole point. Handlers downstream — internal/api/router.go
// and locate.go — SET Vary rather than adding to it, so a value written on the
// way in is silently erased by the time the response leaves. That failure is
// invisible in the code and invisible in a header test that stubs the handler:
// the middleware looks correct, and production ships responses with no Vary:
// Origin at all.
//
// It matters because the API's overview responses are Cache-Control: public
// behind a CDN. A cache keyed without Origin stores one origin's response —
// Access-Control-Allow-Origin included — and replays it to every other origin,
// which turns the allowlist into decoration. Refusals need it for the same
// reason: a refusal is a cacheable response too.
