// to an attacker. Two listeners are capped now — public and tiles — and they
// share this counter, because shedding on either is the same operational event:
// the process is at its socket ceiling. A listener label would be bounded and
// safe to add if an operator ever needs to tell the two apart.

//
// The gap this closes: the server's timeouts bound how long one request may
// take, and nothing bounds how many sockets the process may hold. Tens of
// thousands of mostly-idle connections, each dribbling one header byte every few
// seconds, exhaust file descriptors while completing no request — so no rate
// limiter, breadth counter or admission cap ever sees them.
//
// An over-cap connection is accepted from the kernel and closed immediately,
// rather than left in the backlog. Leaving it queued would make the process look
// healthy while clients hung; closing it is the honest signal, and the
// descriptor is released in the same breath.
//
// A non-positive max returns ln unchanged. A cap that is accidentally zero must
// degrade to "no limiting", never to "no service".
