// The claim was "netip.ParseAddr rejects every string containing a comma, so

// dotted-quad and plain IPv6 form — and false for a ZONE IDENTIFIER. Everything

// trusted proxy names an arbitrary /64 and so chooses which bucket it spends:
// a fresh one per request to evade the limiter entirely, or a victim's to
// exhaust someone else's allowance. Both directions are handed over by one
