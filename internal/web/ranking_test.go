// The province list is ranked by its reading, and the order is a contract, not
// a convenience: a reader opens the home page to find out where the air is bad.
// Nothing asserted it, so a resort or a flipped tier would have shipped green.
//
// The fixture is built to make each rule fail independently if it breaks:
//   - "high" and "low" pin the descending order.
//   - "tie-b" and "tie-a" share a value, so only the name tiebreak can order
//     them — and they are inserted in the wrong order on purpose.
//   - "silent" has no reading at all. Its value would sort FIRST if absence
//     were ever encoded as a zero, so this row is what catches that mistake.
