// HexResolutionKM is the default centre-to-centre spacing of the hex grid, in
// kilometres — what a caller naming no resolution receives.
//
// This was once the only spacing, on the reasoning that a caller free to choose
// could ask for one metre and read the sensor list back a bin at a time. That
// reasoning is superseded and the history matters, because the code below now
// does the thing the old comment forbade:
//
//   - The choice is not free. HexTiersKM is a closed list and a request is
//     snapped onto it, so there is no one-metre bin to ask for — only the
//     tiers we publish.
//   - Every tier is anchored at the same projected origin, so a tier is a fixed
//     tiling of the ground and not a grid re-cut around the request. The
//     extraction the old rule feared came from a grid that could shift under the
//     caller: slide the same cell size a few metres at a time and the moving
//     intersections isolate a point. A fixed anchor removes that seam — asking
//     twice at one tier returns the same bins over the same ground.
//   - Coarse tiers add nothing to the finest one. Hexagons do NOT subdivide into
//     hexagons, so a 15 km bin is not the union of the 2 km bins under it and
//     the tiers cannot be differenced cell-for-cell. What settles the question
//     is simpler: the 250 m tier is published outright, so no combination of
//     coarser tiers can locate anything more precisely than it already does.
//
// What remains true is that the finest tier IS the disclosure: at 250 m a bin
// holding one sensor is that sensor's street. That is a deliberate decision,
// taken to match maps.sensor.community, whose upstream already publishes exact
// sensor coordinates. It is a product choice about how precisely to locate a
// device, not a hole in the grid, and it is the number to revisit if that
// choice is ever reconsidered.
//
// Every visitor asking the same question still gets the same bytes, so
// responses stay publicly cacheable.

// which a lone sensor in a bin is locatable.
//
// The three coarse tiers exist for the national view. The client sizes a cell
// to 32 screen pixels, which at the zoom the country fits on a screen wants a
// bin around 45 km wide; with 15 km as the coarsest, that view was answered
