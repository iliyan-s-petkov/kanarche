// A reader looking at the map is asking one of two questions. What is the air
// like right now — which is what every payload above answers — or what has it
// been like lately, which one bad hour or one dropped sensor cannot swing.
//
// The second question is answered by rebuilding the same payloads from windowed
// means instead of latest readings, and by nothing else: same tiers, same
// coverage rule, same wire shape. That is what lets the client switch windows by
// changing a query parameter rather than by learning a second data model, and
// what lets the server answer from memory either way.
