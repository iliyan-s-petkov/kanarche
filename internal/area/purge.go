// PurgeResult reports what PurgeOutsideBoundary removed. Orphaned readings are

// PurgeOutsideBoundary's doc comment) and an operator needs to be able to tell
// "we ingested foreign sensors" from "someone backfilled a sensor_id that was
// never ingested".

// PurgeOutsideBoundary deletes every sensor (and its stored raw and hourly
// readings) whose location fails ST_Covers against the
// area.kind = NationalBoundaryKind boundary, and reports how many sensors
// were removed.
//
// This is task-17 review finding 4's cleanup: FilterByBoundary only guards
// data ingested after this task shipped. Sensors trusted in under the old
// country-field check (sensor 48524 among them) already have rows in
// `sensor`, `reading` and `reading_hourly`, and — quality.Score being
// purely in-batch — nothing about going forward reaches back to fix that;
// 48524 would otherwise keep rendering in London indefinitely.
//
// This function is deliberately not called from anywhere else in this
// codebase — not from Import, not from FilterByBoundary, not from ingest's
// RunOnce, not on startup. Deleting stored data must always be a single,
// deliberate, operator-invoked action (the `airbg purge-outside-boundary`
// CLI subcommand), never an automatic side effect of importing a boundary
// or of an ordinary ingest cycle. An accidental or partial boundary import
// must not be able to silently wipe sensors.
//
// It fails closed, matching FilterByBoundary: if no NationalBoundaryKind
// boundary exists, it refuses to run and returns an error, rather than
// treating "no boundary to test against" as "nothing qualifies for
// deletion" — the latter would report success (0 removed) while having
// silently done nothing, which looks identical to "the database is
// already clean" and would mask the same missing-import condition
// FilterByBoundary's own fail-closed policy exists to surface.
//
// # Orphaned readings
//
// Discovering rows to delete by selecting from `sensor` is not sufficient on
// its own, and this was a reachability hole rather than a theoretical one.
// `reading.sensor_id` has no foreign key to `sensor(sensor_id)` (reading is a
// hypertable), and `airbg backfill <sensor_id> <csv>` writes straight to
// reading_hourly with an operator-supplied sensor_id and no boundary check. So
// rows could exist for a sensor_id that has no `sensor` row at all — invisible
// to a sensor-driven purge. The one command documented as the cleanup for
// foreign data provably could not reach backfilled foreign data.
//
// Both halves of that are now closed: backfill refuses an unknown or
// out-of-boundary sensor_id up front (see backfill.CheckSensorInBoundary), and
// this function additionally deletes reading/reading_hourly rows with no
// corresponding `sensor` row, so any orphan already stored — including one
// written before that check existed — is reachable. Orphans are reported
// separately from sensors, because an orphan is not evidence of a foreign
// sensor; it is evidence that something wrote readings for a sensor that was
// never ingested, which is a different thing for an operator to know.
