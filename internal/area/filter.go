// NationalBoundaryKind is the area.kind value reserved for the whole-country

// "the national boundary" can never accidentally match a city polygon, and
// vice versa.

// BoundaryFilterResult is what one filtering pass learned. Country carries the
// code of the boundary that covered each accepted sensor, keyed by sensor ID:
// the containment test already knows which country admitted the sensor, and
// recomputing that later would mean a second spatial join over the same points.
//
// MissingCountries lists allow-list entries with no imported boundary. Not an
// error — an operator widening the list before sourcing the geometry is a
// normal intermediate state — but silence about it would look identical to a
// country that genuinely reports no sensors.

// FilterByBoundary partitions readings by whether their sensor's coordinates
// fall inside one of the enabled countries' boundaries, using the same
// ST_Covers predicate AssignSensors already uses for city/oblast/
// neighbourhood containment (task-17 brief: "use the same predicate against
// the national boundary").
//
// Upstream's self-reported country field is not trusted for this (spec
// task-17's motivating case: sensor 48524 reports country "BG" from London).
// Only geometry decides — which is also why the allow list names countries by
// code rather than filtering on the upstream field: the code selects which
// polygons to test against, never what a sensor claims about itself.
//
// countries is the enabled set as ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. Scoping the
// boundary set by config at query time rather than by what happens to be
// imported means disabling a country is a config change, not a re-import, and
// an accidentally imported boundary does not silently start admitting sensors.
// An empty list admits nothing — see boundaryPresent below.
//
// Sensors are deduplicated by ID before the query — a poll batch carries
// several readings (one per metric) per sensor, all sharing one location, so
// there is no reason to test the same point more than once.
//
// BoundaryPresent reports whether any *enabled* country has an imported
// boundary. When it is false the other fields are meaningless — the caller
// must decide what "no boundary to filter against" means for its own pipeline;
// this function only reports the fact, it does not itself choose fail-open or
