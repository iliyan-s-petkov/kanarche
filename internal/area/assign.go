// AssignSensors recomputes the sensor-to-area mapping by point-in-polygon
// containment, in both directions: memberships that now hold are inserted, and
// memberships that no longer hold are withdrawn.
//
// The withdrawal half is not optional, and its absence was a real defect. This
// function used to be `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` alone, with no DELETE
// anywhere in the codebase (purge.go relies only on ON DELETE CASCADE from a
// sensor deletion) — while its doc comment already claimed to "recompute" the
// mapping. Two ordinary events made that claim false:
//
//   - A sensor relocates. store.go states outright that "Location is refreshed
//     on conflict because sensors are occasionally relocated upstream", and does
//     exactly that. A sensor moving from Sofia to Plovdiv got its new location
//     written and a Plovdiv membership added, and kept its Sofia membership
//     forever.
//   - A boundary is re-imported smaller. Import replaces geom on conflict, but
//     memberships derived from the old, larger polygon were never withdrawn.
//
// Phase 2's "which sensors are in area X" query reads area_sensor directly, so
// in both cases it would over-report, permanently and silently. "Sensors do not
// move" (the previous comment's premise) is contradicted by the store's own
// stated behaviour; the mapping is cheap to recompute and must be authoritative
// rather than cumulative.
//
// Delete and insert run in one transaction, so no reader can observe a moment
// where memberships have been withdrawn but not yet re-established.
//
// A sensor may belong to several areas at once: a Sofia sensor is in the Sofia
// city polygon, the Sofia-grad oblast, and its neighbourhood. That is intended,
// and the composite primary key keeps each pairing unique.
//
// area.kind = NationalBoundaryKind ("country") is excluded (task-17 review
// finding 2). That boundary exists solely for FilterByBoundary's ingest-time
// membership test; every sensor that reaches this query has, by
// construction, already passed it. Assigning it to a whole-country
// pseudo-area here would add a meaningless row to every "which areas is
// this sensor in" / "which sensors are in this area" query — exactly the
// confusion NationalBoundaryKind's own doc comment says a distinct kind
// exists to prevent. The delete below also removes any such row an earlier
// (pre-task-17) version of this code may already have written.
