// Package tiles serves the self-hosted basemap: one PMTiles archive, one style
// document, and the glyph atlases MapLibre needs for labels.
//
// It exists as its own package, behind its own listener, because it must hold
// nothing. No database pool, no snapshot, no rate limiter, no admission
// semaphore. A single map load issues dozens of range requests; routed through
// the application's middleware chain they would exhaust the 10/s API bucket on
// the first pan, and raising that bucket to fit them would raise it for the
// JSON API too — the precise thing the limit exists to prevent. Bulkheads
// again: only separate resources can bound one workload's effect on another's
// capacity.

// choice. The archive's name is not: see tiles.archive.

// Cache lifetimes, one per artefact, because the three artefacts are not

//
// immutableCacheControl asks browsers to keep an artefact for a year and never
// revalidate it. That is honest ONLY for the archive, which is addressed by a
// configured, dated filename (tiles.archive, e.g. bulgaria-20260815.pmtiles):
// regenerating the basemap produces a new name, style.json points at the new
// name, and the old URL is simply never requested again. A fixed archive name
// would make this header a lie — returning visitors would keep serving
// themselves last year's map for up to a year. Without the header every visitor
// re-fetches hundreds of megabytes of ranges.
//
// styleCacheControl is short and revalidating because style.json is the one
// artefact whose NAME is fixed (see styleFile) and whose CONTENT changes on
// every regeneration — it is what points at the new archive name. Marked
// immutable it would strand every returning visitor on a cached style document
// naming an archive this handler no longer serves: the allowlist 404s any name
// but the configured one, so the map goes blank, for up to a year, and no
// server-side change can clear it. That failure arrives days after the
// regeneration that caused it, on other people's machines, which is precisely
// the kind nobody connects back to the deploy.
//
// glyphCacheControl is long but not immutable. Glyph paths are fixed too
// (glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf), so a font rebuild reuses the URLs; a day
// bounds how long a stale atlas can outlive it, while still collapsing the
// hundreds of glyph fetches a browsing session makes into one per range.
