# Generating the basemap

The basemap is three static files, generated offline a few times a year and
served as-is by the tiles listener. Nothing here runs in CI: the inputs are
hundreds of megabytes and the cadence is seasonal.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `bulgaria-YYYYMMDD.pmtiles` | OpenMapTiles-schema basemap built from the OSM Bulgaria extract, ~150–300 MB. The date is part of the name, and the name goes in `tiles.archive`. |
| `glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf` | Font atlases MapLibre needs to render labels |
| `style.json` | References the `pmtiles://` source, the glyphs, and the layer styling |

Self-hosting the glyphs is not polish. Fetching them from a public endpoint
would reintroduce exactly the third-party request from a visitor's browser that
this design exists to remove.

## Pinned tool versions

- `planetiler` 0.8.3 (`planetiler.jar`, from the GitHub release)
- Java 21 or newer
- `font-maker` git tag `v0.0.1` (commit `46fac6c`, `maplibre/font-maker`) — this
  is the tool's only tagged release; it has no npm package or semver line, so
  the pin is the git tag, built from a `git clone --recursive` checkout. The
  `cmake . && make` in the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` **does not compile on
  a current clang**: the vendored `sdf-glyph-foundry` triggers six
  `-Wc++11-narrowing-const-reference` errors, which are warnings-as-errors in
  newer toolchains and were not in the one this tag was released against.
  Configure with them demoted:

      cmake . -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-include cstdint -Wno-c++11-narrowing -Wno-c++11-narrowing-const-reference"
      make

  `-include cstdint` is the second half of the same problem: the vendored
  `glyph_foundry.hpp` spells `uint32_t` without including `<cstdint>`, which
  compiled while libstdc++ still pulled that header in transitively and stopped
  compiling at libstdc++ 13. The failure is `unknown type name 'uint32_t'` in a
  header you did not write.

  `CMakeLists.txt` hardcodes `/usr/bin/clang` and `/usr/bin/clang++` and does
  `find_package` on Boost (headers only, ≥1.73) and Freetype. On Ubuntu 24.04
  that is `clang libboost-dev libfreetype-dev` — all three are configure-time
  failures, so none of them is optional.

  Demoting them is safe here — the narrowing is in glyph metric arithmetic that
  the upstream tool has always performed — and it is preferable to unpinning,
  since the pin is what keeps glyph output reproducible.
- Noto Sans, release tag `NotoSans-v2.015` from `notofonts/latin-greek-cyrillic`
  — the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic split covers both the interface's English and the
  Cyrillic `name:bg` labels; a plain "Google Fonts" download is not a pin,
  because Google Fonts does not expose a version history to point at

Pin these. A basemap regenerated with a different planetiler produces different
layer names, and `style.json` references layer names. The same logic applies to
the glyph half of the procedure: a different `font-maker` build or a different
Noto Sans release can shift which codepoints exist or how they're shaped,
which surfaces as labels rendering wrong or not at all — silently, the same
failure class the startup couplings exist to prevent.

`tools/basemap/build.sh` runs §1 through §3 on a Debian-family host, idempotently
— each stage is skipped if its output already exists. `tools/basemap/style.json`
is the §4 style. Both are the record of what was actually run; the sections below
are why.

## 1. The extract

Download the Bulgaria extract from Geofabrik:

    https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/bulgaria-latest.osm.pbf

## 2. The archive

    java -Xmx8g -jar planetiler.jar \
      --osm-path=bulgaria-latest.osm.pbf \
      --output=bulgaria-YYYYMMDD.pmtiles \
      --download \
      --force

`--download` is required, not optional. Without it the run fails immediately
with `IllegalArgumentException: data/sources/lake_centerline.shp.zip does not
exist. Run with --download to fetch it` — the profile pulls several auxiliary
sources (lake centerlines, Natural Earth, water polygons) that are not in the
OSM extract. They are cached under `data/sources/`, so later runs re-use them.

The date suffix is what keeps `Cache-Control: immutable` honest: regeneration
changes the filename, so a cached copy can never be stale. Deploy by writing the
new file, updating `style.json`'s source URL, and only then removing the old one.

## 3. The glyphs

    ./font-maker glyph-out-regular Noto_Sans/NotoSans-Regular.ttf
    ./font-maker glyph-out-medium  Noto_Sans/NotoSans-Medium.ttf
    mkdir -p glyphs
    mv "glyph-out-regular/Noto Sans Regular" glyphs/
    mv "glyph-out-medium/Noto Sans Medium"   glyphs/
    rm -rf glyph-out-regular glyph-out-medium

`font-maker`'s real signature, verified against `main.cpp` in the pinned
checkout (`CONTRIBUTING.md` only shows one example line, so the source is the
authority here) is:

    font-maker <OUTPUT_DIR> <FONT.ttf> [FONT2.ttf ...]

**There is no `--name` flag** at this pin — passing one aborts with
`cxxopts::option_not_exists_exception`. The fontstack name is not an operator
choice at all: `main.cpp` derives it with `fontstack_name(f)` from the font's
own internal family and style records. For the pinned Noto Sans release that
yields **`Noto Sans Regular`** and **`Noto Sans Medium`** — with spaces, not
the hyphenated filenames. Quote them in every shell command, and note that a
URL path segment containing spaces is percent-encoded by the browser and
decoded by the handler, so the on-disk name is the one with spaces.

`OUTPUT_DIR` must **not** already exist — the tool exits with an error
("output directory X exists") rather than merging into it — and it writes
`OUTPUT_DIR/<FONTSTACK>/<start>-<end>.pbf` for every 256-codepoint range the
input font(s) cover. `<FONTSTACK>` is exactly the on-disk directory name and
exactly what `style.json`'s `text-font` must name, character for character.
Passing several font files to one invocation merges them into a **single**
fontstack as fallback faces, which is not what two separate weights need, so
Regular and Medium are two separate invocations. Because `OUTPUT_DIR` can't
already exist, the two runs can't both target `glyphs` directly; each goes to
its own throwaway staging directory and is then moved into the shared `glyphs/`
tree that `internal/tiles` serves — `glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`, exactly
that depth, or the handler's allowlist 404s it.

Generate a fontstack for every `text-font` the style references, and no more.
Since the names come from the font rather than from a flag, the way to learn
them is to run the tool and list `OUTPUT_DIR`; guessing produces a style whose
`text-font` doesn't match, and then the glyph fetch 404s and the label silently
disappears rather than erroring — there is no visible failure to debug from.

## 4. The style

**The archive is OpenMapTiles schema, not Protomaps.** planetiler's default
profile emits the OpenMapTiles layer set — `water`, `waterway`, `landcover`,
`landuse`, `park`, `boundary`, `transportation`, `transportation_name`,
`building`, `place`, `poi`, `housenumber`, `aeroway`, `aerodrome_label`,
`water_name`, `mountain_peak`. Earlier revisions of this document, and the
Phase 1 design, said Protomaps; that was wrong about what the §2 command
produces. A Protomaps theme names layers that do not exist in this archive, so
it renders a **blank map with no error** — every layer simply matches nothing.

Style against the OpenMapTiles layer names, and set:

- `sources.<name>.url` to `pmtiles://<tiles.public_url>/<tiles.archive>` — the
  same dated filename you generated in §2, e.g.
  `pmtiles://https://tiles.kanarche.eu/bulgaria-20260815.pmtiles` — with each
  layer's `source-layer` naming one of the layers above
- `glyphs` to `<tiles.public_url>/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`, and every
  layer's `text-font` to a fontstack name §3 actually produced (`Noto Sans
  Regular`, `Noto Sans Medium` — with the spaces)
- every label layer's `text-field` to `["coalesce", ["get", "name:bg"], ["get", "name"]]`,
  so the basemap follows the interface language
- `attribution` to `© OpenStreetMap contributors`

The attribution is a licence obligation, not presentation: the data is
OpenStreetMap under ODbL, and that is the whole of the obligation. Credit no one
else — planetiler processed the data, it did not contribute any, and an
attribution line naming a party with no claim misstates provenance rather than
erring on the generous side. The page footer carries the same credit in its
Data sources column (`footer.src.osm` in `internal/i18n/*.json`, linked to
openstreetmap.org/copyright), pinned by `internal/web/render_test.go`'s
`TestBasemapAttribution`.

## 5. Install

Lay the three artefacts out under `tiles.dir`, keeping the dated archive name:

    /var/lib/airbg/tiles/
      style.json
      bulgaria-20260815.pmtiles
      glyphs/Noto Sans Regular/0-255.pbf
      glyphs/Noto Sans Medium/0-255.pbf
      ...

Then set `tiles.archive` to that filename:

```yaml
tiles:
  addr: "127.0.0.1:8082"
  dir: "/var/lib/airbg/tiles"
  public_url: "https://tiles.kanarche.eu"
  archive: "bulgaria-20260815.pmtiles"   # regeneration changes this
```

Do **not** rename or symlink the archive to a fixed name. The handler serves
exactly one archive name — the configured one — and the archive alone carries
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. That header is only
truthful because regeneration produces a new filename and therefore a new URL:
reuse the name and every returning visitor keeps serving themselves the old
basemap for up to a year, with no way to invalidate it.

The other two artefacts have fixed names, so they get revalidating lifetimes
instead: `style.json` 5 minutes (it is the file a regeneration rewrites, and a
visitor holding an immutable copy of it would keep asking for an archive the
handler no longer serves — a blank map for a year), glyphs one day. The bound
on how long a deploy takes to reach returning visitors is therefore the
`style.json` lifetime, not the archive's.

Three names must agree: the file on disk, `tiles.archive`, and the
`pmtiles://` URL inside `style.json` (§4). The first two are checked at
startup — the handler refuses to start if `style.json`, the configured archive
or `glyphs/` is missing, so a mis-set `tiles.dir` or `tiles.archive` is a
startup failure rather than a blank map nobody notices. The third is not
checkable from the server, because `style.json` is an opaque generated
artefact: if it points at a name the handler does not serve, the basemap is
blank and only the browser's network panel says so.

## 5a. Regenerating

Every regeneration is: build a new `bulgaria-YYYYMMDD.pmtiles`, point
`style.json` at the new name, update `tiles.archive`, restart. The old archive
can stay on disk for as long as you like — the handler will not serve it once
`tiles.archive` names the new one — and should be deleted once no cached page
still references it.

## 5b. Who may read the tiles

The tiles are on their own host, so every fetch of them is cross-origin and
the browser will only hand the bytes to a page whose origin the listener names
back. `listen.base_url` is always allowed and is **not** listed — the site
being unable to read its own basemap is not a state worth being able to
configure. `tiles.allowed_origins` adds to that list; empty is the shipped
setting and means the site alone.

```yaml
tiles:
  # ...the four keys above...
  allowed_origins:
    - "https://kit.example"
```

Scheme and host only. No trailing slash, no path, no `*`. A browser's `Origin`
header carries none of those, and the listener compares byte for byte, so any
of them is an entry that matches nothing — which looks exactly like the problem
you added it to solve. Startup validation rejects them by value rather than
letting them sit there silently, and `"*"` is refused outright: it is not a
wider allowlist, it is no allowlist.

Three things are part of the contract, not incidental:

- **The requesting origin is echoed back**, not the first configured one. A
  browser compares `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the `Origin` it sent.
- **`Vary: Origin` is on every response**, including the ones with no CORS
  headers at all. Without it a shared cache can replay an allowed origin's
  response — header included — to one that is not on the list, and the
  allowlist stops meaning anything.
- **An origin that is not on the list gets no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
  header**, not an empty one. The status is still `200`: the bytes are public,
  and it is the browser that declines to hand them to the page.

`Range` is preflighted, so `OPTIONS` is answered here with
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Range`; `Content-Range` and `Content-Length` are
exposed, because PMTiles must read a range response, not merely receive it.

Adding an origin needs no basemap regeneration and no change to the app's CSP —
`connect-src` governs what the *site* may fetch, and the other host has a CSP
of its own.

**The design kit is deliberately not in this list.** It is served from
`https://kanarche.eu/design-kit/`, so its fetches come from an origin that is
already allowed, and the preview it renders is the one production renders.
Because the kit is same-origin, the app's `connect-src` is what governs its tile
fetches — the deployed policy already names `tiles.public_url`'s origin, and
startup validation fails loudly if it stops doing so. A *mirror* of the kit
served from somewhere else is a different question: see 5c.

## 5c. Loopback origins

```yaml
tiles:
  allow_loopback_origins: false   # shipped setting
```

Allows any `http` origin on the requesting machine — anything in `127.0.0.0/8`,
`::1`, or the name `localhost`, on any port — in addition to everything in 5b.

It exists for **design-preview hosts that bind an ephemeral port**. OpenDesign
serves its mirror of the kit from `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` and picks a new port
on every launch, so the origin is not knowable when the config is written. It
cannot be an `allowed_origins` entry for the same reason `*` cannot: that list
is matched byte for byte, so a wildcard there would match nothing while looking
correct — the silent failure 5b's validation exists to refuse. A separate rule
keeps that guarantee intact.

The failure it fixes is a quiet one. Without the header the preview falls back
to plain SVG shapes, and since the hex overlay only draws over a real basemap,
the reviewer sees the *previous* design rather than an error. A correct build
and a broken one look identical.

Matching is by parse, not by prefix: `http://127.0.0.1.evil.test` and
`http://evil.test.localhost` both begin or end with the string a looser check
would accept, and neither is loopback. `https` loopback is refused too — a
preview server serves plain `http`, and accepting TLS would extend the rule to
whatever terminates it on that host's behalf.

**What it does and does not widen.** It widens *who* may read, never *what*: the
path allowlist, the archive name and the cache headers are unchanged. And the
restriction it relaxes was never a secrecy control — the tiles are OSM-derived
public data, and a non-browser client gets `200` with no `Origin` header at all.
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` constrains browsers; it is a hotlinking and
bandwidth control, which is what makes this switch cheap. Production runs it on
for exactly that reason; it ships off so an operator who never asked for a
preview host does not get one.

## 5d. The same switch on the JSON API

```yaml
listen:
  allow_loopback_origins: false   # shipped setting
```

A basemap without data is a blank map with hexes missing, so the preview needs
`/api/v1/*` cross-origin too. `listen.base_url` is always allowed; this key adds
the same loopback rule 5c describes, sharing one matcher (`internal/origin`) so
the two surfaces cannot drift apart on what "loopback" means.

**A separate key, deliberately.** The tiles listener holds nothing — no pool, no
snapshot, no limiter. This one carries the per-client rate limiters, the
enumeration tiering, and responses the CDN caches. Widening the basemap should
not silently widen the data API, and the key path should name the surface it
opens.

Two things make this safe where a naive CORS patch would not be:

- **The limiter still applies.** `httpx.CORS` sits *inside* the middleware
  chain, so a cross-origin request is rate-limited before it reaches the header
  logic. It widens who may read, never how much.
- **`Vary: Origin` on every response, including refusals** — and added on the
  way *out*, not the way in. The API handlers `Set` `Vary` rather than adding to
  it, so a value written before the handler runs is erased before the response
  leaves. Since the overview responses are `Cache-Control: public` behind a CDN,
  a cache keyed without `Origin` would store one origin's response — `ACAO` and
  all — and replay it to every other. Refusals need the header for the same
  reason: a refusal is a cacheable response too.

## 5e. Origins that are not http

```yaml
tiles:
  allowed_origins: ["od://app"]
  allowed_origin_schemes: ["od"]
listen:
  allowed_origins: ["od://app"]
  allowed_origin_schemes: ["od"]
```

The loopback rule in 5c covers a preview daemon on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
It does not cover OpenDesign, which registers `od:` as a standard, secure,
CORS-enabled scheme and renders the preview frame at **`od://app`** — a real,
specific origin that is neither loopback nor https. Nothing in 5b or 5c can
name it, so the style fetch was refused and the preview fell back to the SVG
basemap: correct behaviour, visually identical to a broken build.

**Why a second key rather than widening the check.** `allowed_origins` is
matched byte for byte, so the validator's job is to refuse entries that can
never match anything — and restricting schemes to http and https is what
catches `htps://kit.example`, an entry that looks right and matches nothing
forever. Dropping that check to admit one scheme would trade a silent,
permanent failure mode for a keystroke. Declaring the scheme instead keeps the
default set meaningful and makes the unusual thing something an operator wrote
down.

**What the declaration grants.** Only that an origin using that scheme may be
*listed*. `allowed_origin_schemes: ["od"]` does not admit `od://` traffic; it
admits `od://app` because `allowed_origins` names it. `od://somewhere-else`
stays refused. Every other shape rule still applies — no wildcard, no path, no
trailing slash.

**What it costs, stated plainly.** `od://app` is the origin of *any* OpenDesign
install on any machine, not one person's. Allowlisting it means "any copy of
that desktop app may read this". For the basemap that is uncontroversial: the
tiles are OSM-derived public data on a public map, and the ACAO header is a
hotlinking control, not a secrecy one — a client sending no `Origin` already
gets the bytes. For the JSON API the same reasoning holds and the guarantees of
5d still bind: the rate limiter runs first, no credentials are sent (there is no
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, so no cookie rides along), and a
cross-origin reader gets exactly what a server-side `fetch` already gets. It is
still a wider grant than 5c, which at least required being on the machine.
Removing both entries returns the surface to base-url-only.

## 6. The firewall rule

This is load-bearing, not advisory. Serving tiles from the origin means a
hostname that resolves to the origin IP, and the anti-scraping design depends on
that IP being unknown: `CF-Connecting-IP` is attacker-controlled on a direct
connection, and every rate limiter keys off it.

- The **application vhost** (`kanarche.eu`) requires a TLS client certificate
  issued by Cloudflare's origin-pull CA, enforced by Caddy
  (`deploy/Caddyfile`). A direct connection to the origin IP fails the
  handshake whatever its source address. This replaces the IP allowlist this
  section originally proposed: an allowlist trusts where a packet came from,
  and anything hosted inside Cloudflare's ranges qualifies.
- The **tiles vhost** (`tiles.kanarche.eu`) accepts the world, on a DNS-only
  hostname, with a publicly trusted certificate. It shares port 443 with the
  application vhost — which is why the enforcement has to be per-vhost. SNI is
  above the layer a packet filter works at.
- `listen.trusted_proxy_cidrs` governs header parsing, not who may connect, and
  in this deployment it names the reverse proxy's own Docker subnet — not
  Cloudflare's ranges, which never appear as a peer address.

With this in place, discovering the origin IP yields tiles and a TLS rejection.

## 7. Sizing the tiles host

Nothing fronts `tiles.addr` — that is the point of the DNS-only hostname, and it
means every byte is served from the origin's own bandwidth. Size for it before
deploying, because the ceiling is not obvious:

`listen.max_conns` caps concurrent connections on the tiles listener as well as
the public one, and a single unranged `GET /<tiles.archive>` transfers the whole
archive. Worst-case concurrent egress is therefore `listen.max_conns` × the
archive size — with the shipped cap and a ~300 MB Bulgaria extract, that is
substantial.

No real client does this: MapLibre reads the archive through the `pmtiles`
protocol, which issues ranged requests for the few megabytes a viewport needs.
The unranged GET is a `curl` away, though, so treat it as a bandwidth
consideration when choosing the host, not as an attack that has been closed.

## Deployment decisions

Both questions this section used to leave open are settled (see also
[deployment.md](deployment.md)):

- `tiles.dir` is a **bind-mounted host directory** (`/var/lib/airbg/tiles`),
  mounted read-only into the app container. The image stays ~27 MB and
  regenerating the basemap is an scp rather than a rebuild — which matters
  because releases ship the whole image over the wire.
- `tiles.kanarche.eu` is served a **publicly trusted Let's Encrypt certificate**,
  not a Cloudflare Origin CA one: browsers connect straight here, and they do
  not trust an Origin CA certificate. As built it is not a certificate of its
  own — the design called for Caddy to obtain one, but the host runs certbot
  over DNS-01 and `tiles.kanarche.eu` is a SAN on the single certificate that also
  covers `kanarche.eu`. Dropping the name from that lineage breaks this vhost.
  See `deploy/README.md`, "the origin certificate".
