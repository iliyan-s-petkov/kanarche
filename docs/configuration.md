# Configuration

`airbg` takes every operational constant from configuration — there are no
defaults in code. This document is the operator-facing reference; the
authoritative record of *why* each shipped value is what it is lives in
`airbg.yaml` itself (as comments next to each key) and, for the small set of
values Phase 3b pinned against pre-sweep behaviour, in
`internal/config/inert_test.go`.

## 1. The two layers

Configuration is resolved in exactly two layers, in this order:

1. **The file** named by `AIRBG_CONFIG` (see below) — a YAML document
   matching the schema in `internal/config/schema.go`.
2. **The environment** — `AIRBG_*` variables that override individual keys
   from the file (see §3), plus the two secrets that are environment-only
   (§4).

Every `AIRBG_*` name is also read as `KANARCHE_*`, which wins when both are set.
The `AIRBG_*` prefix is deprecated but still read, and logs a warning per key.

There is no third layer and no compiled-in fallback. A key that is present in
neither the file nor the environment is a **startup error**, not a zero
value — for most of these keys, zero is the dangerous setting (an unlimited
listener, a disabled rate limit, an unbounded query). `internal/config/load.go`
collects every missing key at once and reports the whole list in one error, so
fixing configuration is not a one-restart-per-key exercise.

## 2. Where the file comes from

`AIRBG_CONFIG` must name the path to the config file. There is **no fallback
path** — the loader does not guess `./airbg.yaml` or `/etc/airbg/airbg.yaml`
on its own. Guessing a path is a default in disguise, and this project keeps
none. If `AIRBG_CONFIG` is unset, every subcommand that loads configuration
(`serve`, `collect`, `validate-config`, etc.) fails immediately with:

```
config: AIRBG_CONFIG is not set; it must name the airbg.yaml to load
```

## 3. The override rule

Any key in the file can be overridden by an environment variable. The rule is
mechanical, with no lookup table and no exceptions among overridable keys:

**`AIRBG_` + the full dotted key path, uppercased, with `.` replaced by `_`.**

Four worked examples:

```
listen.addr                      → AIRBG_LISTEN_ADDR
listen.metrics_addr              → AIRBG_LISTEN_METRICS_ADDR
upstream.poll_interval           → AIRBG_UPSTREAM_POLL_INTERVAL
quality.ranges.pressure.min      → AIRBG_QUALITY_RANGES_PRESSURE_MIN
```

The rule is true by construction, not by a hand-maintained table that can
drift: `internal/config/load.go`'s `applyEnv` walks the same struct tags the
YAML decoder uses to derive each variable name.

## 4. The one env-only secret

One value is **never** read from the file, because it is a credential and
`airbg.yaml` is committed to the repository:

| Variable | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `AIRBG_DATABASE_URL` | The PostgreSQL connection string |

Writing it into `airbg.yaml` is a **hard rejection at load time**, not a
silently-ignored value. So is any recognisable secret-shaped key name, at any
depth: `database_url`, `dsn`, `password`, `api_key`, `secret`, `token`, and
bare **`key`**. One further rejection is by full path rather than by name —
`database.url` — because `url` is legitimate under `upstream` but never under
`database`.

This is enforced by `internal/config/load.go`'s `rejectSecrets`, which walks
every key in the parsed document before the schema is even decoded, so a
credential pasted into the committed file fails the very first load rather than
being merely unused. The error names the environment variable the value should
have gone to; it never echoes the value.

The basemap has no equivalent secret: it is self-hosted, not a vendor style URL
with an API key substituted in. See [`docs/tiles.md`](tiles.md) and ["The
basemap"](#the-basemap) below.

## 5. What cannot be overridden from the environment

`series.periods` cannot be set or adjusted via `AIRBG_*`. There is no sane
environment-variable name for "the third list entry's `window` field" — a list
of structured records belongs in the file, not flattened into a variable name.
To change a period's window, cache lifetime, or add/remove a period entirely,
edit `airbg.yaml` directly.

## 6. The renamed variables

Phase 3b's cutover to `airbg.yaml` renamed most existing `AIRBG_*` variables to
match the mechanical rule in §3. This is a **breaking change**: the old names
are no longer read by the loader at all, silently or otherwise.

| old | new |
| --- | --- |
| `AIRBG_LISTEN_ADDR` | `AIRBG_LISTEN_ADDR` (unchanged) |
| `AIRBG_METRICS_ADDR` | `AIRBG_LISTEN_METRICS_ADDR` |
| `AIRBG_BASE_URL` | `AIRBG_LISTEN_BASE_URL` |
| `AIRBG_POLL_INTERVAL` | `AIRBG_UPSTREAM_POLL_INTERVAL` |
| `AIRBG_UPSTREAM_URL` | `AIRBG_UPSTREAM_URL` (unchanged) |
| `AIRBG_DB_API_CONNS` | `AIRBG_DATABASE_API_CONNS` |
| `AIRBG_DB_COLLECTOR_CONNS` | `AIRBG_DATABASE_COLLECTOR_CONNS` |
| `AIRBG_MAX_CONNS` | `AIRBG_LISTEN_MAX_CONNS` |
| `AIRBG_MAX_DB_INFLIGHT` | `AIRBG_DATABASE_MAX_INFLIGHT` |
| `AIRBG_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | `AIRBG_LISTEN_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` |

`AIRBG_DATABASE_URL` (§4) and `AIRBG_CONFIG` (§2) are new names with no
predecessor. `AIRBG_LIVE_TEST` is a test-only switch, not configuration, and is
unaffected by any of this. `AIRBG_BASEMAP_STYLE_URL` and `AIRBG_BASEMAP_KEY`
were later **deleted**, not renamed — see ["The basemap"](#the-basemap) below.

## 7. `airbg validate-config`

Run `airbg validate-config` to load configuration exactly as `serve` and
`collect` would, then report the result and exit. It is meant to be a deploy
gate: wire it into CI or a pre-deploy hook and treat a non-zero exit as "do
not deploy."

- **Exit 0**: configuration loaded and passed every check in
  `Config.Validate()`. Stdout is a tab-aligned table of the operationally
  significant values (listener addresses, pool sizes, poll interval, cache
  age, rate limits, coverage threshold, and the four `tiles.*` keys) plus a
  `configuration is valid` line. `tiles.*` rows are printed even when
  empty — that is the shipped, supported state, not an absent key, and an
  operator debugging a blank map should not have to guess whether the basemap
  is unconfigured or unsupported.
- **Exit 1**: either the file could not be read/parsed, a required key was
  missing, or a semantic check failed (see §9). The problem is printed to
  stderr.

It **never prints a secret**. `AIRBG_DATABASE_URL` is reported only as `(set)`
or `(not set)` — never its value — so the command is safe to run in a CI log.
This also holds for the failure path: a malformed `tiles.public_url` is
reported by reason only (e.g. "invalid port"), never by echoing the URL
itself.

## 8. The two colour homes

Colour values live in exactly one of two places, split by a mechanical rule:

- **`internal/web/static/theme.css`** — anything a CSS rule can style: page
  chrome, buttons, text, borders, backgrounds behind HTML elements.
- **`frontend.*` in `airbg.yaml`** — the paint values that are handed
  directly to WebGL (MapLibre) layers and the chart `<canvas>`, which CSS
  cannot reach at all: `frontend.no_data_colour`, `frontend.unscaled_colour`,
  `frontend.marker_stroke_colour`, `frontend.empty_basemap_colour`,
  `frontend.chart_line_colour`. `no_data_colour` and `unscaled_colour` are
  deliberately different colours: "we have no reading" and "this metric has
  no band table" are different facts, and painting both the same grey makes a
  working map indistinguishable from a broken one.

The boundary is mechanical, not aesthetic: if CSS can style it, it belongs in
`theme.css`; if JavaScript passes it to a canvas or a GL layer, it belongs in
`frontend.*`.

**Band colours are in neither place.** The EAQI/EU-limit/WHO scale bands come
from `/api/v1/scales` at request time, because they are legislation, not a
visual constant — a legislative change to the bands is a one-file server
edit, not a config or CSS change.

## 9. The checked couplings

Several values are related to each other in ways `Config.Validate()` checks
at load time, so a misconfiguration fails at startup rather than in
production:

| Coupling | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `listen.addr` ≠ `listen.metrics_addr` | Sharing the address would expose `/metrics` on the public listener — handing an attacker the exact counters that show whether their probing is being rate limited. |
| `cache.data_max_age` ≤ `upstream.poll_interval / 2` | A client caching longer than half an ingest cycle can be shown a reading that has already been superseded by the next poll. |
| `upstream.poll_interval` ≥ `upstream.min_poll_interval` | Polling the volunteer-run public sensor.community API faster than the floor is abusive; the floor is enforced, not advisory. |
| `series.default_window` matches a configured `series.periods[].window` | The snapshot serves the default window without touching the database. If no period shares that window, the snapshot would answer a question no period actually asks. |
| `database.statement_timeouts.series` ≤ `.default` | `/series` is the most expensive public query and runs while holding a scarce admission slot; its budget must be the tighter one, never looser than the pool default. |
| `frontend.zoom_city` < `frontend.zoom_sensor` | The map has three tiers — country, then city, then sensor — and the zoom thresholds must preserve that order or a zoom level would resolve to no tier or the wrong one. |
| `listen.csp` must not contain `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval` | Either directive makes the Content-Security-Policy decorative; an inline-script allowance is the single most common way a CSP stops mitigating XSS. Making the policy configurable must not make it disableable. |
| `tiles.public_url`'s host must appear in `listen.csp`'s `connect-src` | MapLibre fetches the style, the glyphs and the `.pmtiles` ranges over `fetch`/XHR; a CSP that omits the host fails closed and the map is blank, with nothing on the server to say why. |
| `tiles.addr`, `tiles.dir`, `tiles.public_url` and `tiles.archive` are all-or-nothing, and `tiles.addr` must differ from both `listen.addr` and `listen.metrics_addr` | A partially configured basemap is not a smaller basemap, it is a broken one; and a tiles listener sharing an address with either of the other two is the "three listeners simplified back to two" mistake, in configuration. |
| `tiles.archive` must be a plain filename, with no path separator and not `.` or `..` | Defence in depth and a clearer error, not the control that stops traversal — `internal/tiles` reads through `os.DirFS`, which already bounds every read to `tiles.dir`. What the check buys is that a name with a path in it fails at startup naming the key, rather than passing the handler's existence check and then being refused by its one-segment allowlist on every request, which looks like a blank map. |

All of these are enforced in `internal/config/validate.go`; a violation is
reported alongside every other problem in one `config: N problem(s)` error,
not one restart at a time.

## The basemap

`tiles.*` empty is legal and is what this repository ships: two listeners, and
a map that renders sensor markers over `frontend.empty_basemap_colour`. Local
development needs no vendor account and no 300 MB file.

Setting all four keys starts a third listener serving the self-hosted basemap
artefacts. It holds no database pool, no snapshot, no rate limiter
and no admission semaphore — that is what makes it safe to expose directly
while the application port accepts only Cloudflare's ranges. Generating the
artefacts: `docs/tiles.md`.

## Message overrides and adding a language

The site's copy lives in `internal/i18n/bg.json` and `en.json`, embedded in the
binary. Bulgarian is the default; every other language is served under its own
path prefix (`/en/`). No user-visible string is written in Go or in `web/src` —
`web/src/lib/literals.test.js` fails the build if one appears there — so copy is
changed by editing a catalogue, not by editing code.

`i18n.dir` points at a directory of `<lang>.json` files, read once at startup.
It does two jobs:

```yaml
i18n:
  dir: "/etc/airbg/messages"
```

**Correcting copy.** A clumsy sentence, or a translation a native speaker
rejects, that needs fixing before the next release. Name only the keys you are
changing; everything else keeps its embedded text.

```json
// /etc/airbg/messages/bg.json
{
  "panel.flag.stuck": "Стойността не се е променяла отдавна."
}
```

**Adding a language.** Write `<code>.json` — `de.json`, `ro.json`, `de-at.json`
— containing *every* key the Bulgarian catalogue holds, and restart. The
language is then routed (`/de/`, `/de/areas`, `/de/area/{slug}`), listed in the
language switcher, offered as a `rel="alternate"` to search engines, and used by
the map island's own navigation. **No rebuild, no database migration, no code
change.** Nothing in the binary enumerates the languages: routes, the switcher,
and `hreflang` are all derived from the catalogues that loaded.

Two conventions make that work:

- `lang.name` is that language's name written *in that language* (`"English"`,
  `"Български"`) — it is the label the switcher shows for it. A reader who
  cannot read the current page is exactly who that link is for.
- **Area names** need no `name_de` column. Any language other than Bulgarian
  gets the stored Latin-script `name_en` by default (`Sofia`, not `София`). To
  override one, add the optional key `area.name.<slug>`:

  ```json
  { "area.name.sofia": "Sofia Stadt" }
  ```

  These keys are optional in every catalogue and are the one exception to the
  "must exist in the embedded catalogue" rule below.

Empty `i18n.dir` (the shipped setting) means embedded catalogues only.

Six things are startup errors rather than warnings, because each is an edit that
would otherwise appear to work and not:

| Situation | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| A filename that is not a language code (`bulgarian.json`, `notes.json`) | The file would be read by nothing, in silence. Codes are `xx` or `xx-yy`, lowercase — the name becomes a URL path segment. |
| A new language missing keys the default catalogue holds | The missing keys fall back to Bulgarian, so the page renders in two languages at once and looks deliberate. The error lists what is missing. |
| A key the embedded catalogue does not hold (and is not `area.name.*`) | A typo, or a key a later release retired. Silently ignored, it looks applied. |
| A blank value | Renders an empty label, the exact outcome the `!key!` fallback marker exists to prevent. |
| An unparseable or empty catalogue | Every label on the page would render as a fallback marker. |
| A missing `i18n.dir` | The operator meant to serve corrected copy. Falling back to the embedded text would look healthy while serving the words they replaced. |

Overrides are read **once, at startup**. Editing a file changes nothing until
the process restarts — no watcher, and no operator-controlled filesystem read
on the hot path of every page.

Two things a new language does *not* reach today, both outside the rendered
site: `/api/v1/locate` returns the area's `name_bg` regardless of language (it
is an internal endpoint with no language parameter), and non-JSON files in the
override directory are ignored on purpose, so backups and notes can live beside
the catalogues.

## 10. Rate limiting: eviction intervals and the two `Retry-After`s

There are four limiters (api, pages, series, enumerate), configured asymmetrically on purpose. `ratelimit.pages` covers every path outside `/api/`, is looser than the API bucket so a crawler fetching the sitemap in a burst is not refused, and sweeps on its own `evict_interval`.

**`evict_interval` is per limiter.** It is how often a limiter's key map is
swept for idle entries, and bounding that map is a memory-exhaustion defence,
not housekeeping: every distinct client IP creates an entry, so an unswept map
is what an attacker grows. Each limiter therefore sweeps on **its own**
configured interval, in `internal/server/server.go`'s `startEvicting`.

There is exactly one exception, and it is deliberate: the **enumerate/breadth
limiter has no `evict_interval` key of its own** and is swept on
`ratelimit.api.evict_interval`. If a key is ever added under
`ratelimit.enumerate`, `startEvicting` must be changed to use it — an
undocumented shared value is how `ratelimit.series.evict_interval` came to be
configured but ignored.

**`retry_after` is not one thing.** The two values that exist answer different
questions, and one more is deliberately absent:

| Key | Status code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(none under `ratelimit.api`)* | 429 | Not configurable, and not an oversight. The hint on a rate-limit refusal is **computed** from the refusing client's own token deficit, so it names the moment a token actually exists instead of a fixed guess. A configured value here could only be wrong. |
| `ratelimit.series.retry_after` | 503 | The hint on the series routes' *admission* refusal — the database in-flight cap (`database.max_inflight`) is full. An admission decision, not a rate-limit one: no bucket rejected the request, so nothing about it is computable from a token deficit. |
| `ratelimit.enumerate.retry_after` | 429 | The breadth limiter's hint. Fixed because that limiter is a fixed window, not a token bucket, so the wait is the window, not a deficit. |

A fourth `Retry-After` exists in the code and is **not** configuration:
`internal/api/router.go`'s data-not-ready 503, sent when the store has no
usable data yet. It is about ingest state, not about limits.

## 11. Values that used to be constants

Phase 3b moved the last operational constants out of Go and JavaScript. They
behave exactly as before; only their home changed, and `internal/config/inert_test.go`
pins each one to the value of the constant it replaced.

| Key | Consumed by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quality.pm_ratio_threshold` | `internal/quality/spatial.go` | A PM reading is flagged as a spatial outlier only if it exceeds this multiple of its neighbours' median. Guards against flagging a real, genuinely regional pollution episode. |
| `quality.pm_absolute_threshold` | `internal/quality/spatial.go` | …**and** exceeds this absolute µg/m³ value. Both guards must trip; either alone spares the reading. Raising either makes the flagging more permissive. |
| `quality.smooth_field_floors.{temperature,humidity,pressure}` | `internal/quality/spatial.go` | Minimum deviation, in each metric's own unit, below which a reading is never flagged however tight its neighbours agree. Without a floor, a cluster of identical readings gives a zero spread and flags ordinary noise. A metric absent from this map (e.g. `noise_LAeq`) has no floor and is never spatially flagged on this path. |
| `frontend.default_zoom`, `frontend.default_lon`, `frontend.default_lat` | `internal/web/templates/index.gohtml`, `internal/api/locate.go` | The map's opening view — the national fallback used before geolocation resolves, and the body `/api/v1/locate` returns when it cannot place a client. Previously duplicated as three hardcoded literals in a template, a Go file and a JS island; there is now no JS-side fallback, so the attributes the server renders are the only source. |
| `tiles.addr`, `tiles.dir`, `tiles.public_url`, `tiles.archive` | `internal/tiles`, `internal/server`, `internal/web/render.go` | The self-hosted basemap's listen address, artefact directory, public origin, and PMTiles filename. Shipped **empty** in `airbg.yaml`: no basemap, two listeners instead of three, sensor markers over `frontend.empty_basemap_colour`. Setting all four (never fewer) starts the tiles listener; see ["The basemap"](#the-basemap) and `docs/tiles.md`. `tiles.archive` carries the build date (`bulgaria-20260815.pmtiles`) because tile responses are cached immutably for a year: regeneration must change the filename, or returning visitors keep the old basemap. |
