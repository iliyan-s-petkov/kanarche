// getZoom() bottoms out at the constrained floor while getMinZoom() keeps
// saying 0, so installZoom's `z <= getMinZoom()` never fires and the minus
// button stays live over a camera that has stopped moving. Setting it makes the
// reported floor the reachable one. It used to be 5 — "a map of one country,
// nothing below it to zoom out to" — which stopped a reader from putting
