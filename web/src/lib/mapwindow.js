// "What is the air like right now" is one reading from each sensor, and it is
// what every map on this site showed until now. It is also the reading a single
// bad hour, a passing lorry or one dropped device can swing. "What has it been
// like lately" is the other question, and the server answers it from the same
// endpoints with a ?window= parameter (see internal/snapshot/window.go) — same
// tiers, same wire shape, only the numbers differ.
//
// So the client half is small on purpose: a name, a URL, and a remembered
// choice. Everything that decides anything here is a pure function, because the
// map island that calls them needs a real MapLibre instance and is therefore
// out of a test's reach.

 * over the thing it describes. Radios rather than the layers menu's checkboxes
 * — the window is ONE choice out of four, which is the one shape a checkbox
 * list cannot state.
 *
 * The button carries the chosen window's own text, so the map says which
 * question it is answering without the reader having to open anything.
 *
 * `host` is where the control is appended — the freshness pill's own box, so
 * the two are laid out as one flex row and the gap between them is a gap rather
 * than a guess at how wide the pill is. It defaults to the frame, which is what
 * a map rendered without the freshness line gets. The panel's id still comes
 * from the FRAME: it is the element the templates give an id to.
 *
 * `footer` is an element parked below the options — on a phone, the refresh
 * controls, which have no corner of their own there. The box is built whether
 * or not one is given, so a rotation back onto a phone has somewhere to put
 * them; empty, the sheet hides it.
