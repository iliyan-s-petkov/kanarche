// A station is a place with sensors on it. The wire talks about devices.
//
// Upstream publishes one address as SEVERAL sensor ids: the particulate box
// (SDS011, SPS30, PMS5003) and the climate box (BME280, SHT3x) are separate
// devices with separate ids and the same published coordinate, each reporting
// only what its own hardware measures. Nationwide that is 259 devices at 151
// addresses. Drawn one marker per device, the climate box lands exactly under
// the particulate box where nothing can click it, and the particulate box's
// panel answers "no reading" for a temperature being measured a metre away.
//
// The payload keeps saying what each device measured — that is the honest
// record, and it is what the per-sensor chart endpoints are keyed by — and
// carries a `station` column joining the devices at one address (see
// internal/snapshot/build.go's stationIDs). This module is the client half:
// everything the reader sees as one thing on the map is grouped here, once,
// so the markers, the count line and the panel cannot disagree about how many
// there are.

// The columns every sensor row carries that are NOT a metric reading:
//
//   id       - the sensor's identity, not a reading
//   type     - the hardware model, not a reading
//   lon/lat  - the sensor's location, not a reading
//   quality  - the sensor's own data-quality flag, exposed to the panel as
//              `flag` because it is metadata ABOUT the readings
//   flags    - per-metric unusable flags, see flagsAt
//   faulty   - metrics the server's 24h rule marks faulty, see isFaultyAt
//   station  - the address join key, this file's own subject
//   measures - what each device's hardware measures, see measuresAt
//   first_seen / last_seen
//            - the device's lifetime as our ingest saw it, metadata about the
//              readings rather than one of them
//   source   - which network the row came from, "sensor.community" or "eea"
//
// Every other key in the columnar body is a canonical metric column
// (upstream.CanonicalMetrics, internal/snapshot/build.go). Deriving the metric
// list by exclusion from this fixed list — rather than an allow-list of known
// metrics — is what lets a metric added server-side reach the panel with no
// frontend change.
