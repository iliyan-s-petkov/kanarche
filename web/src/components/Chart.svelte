  // Two ways in, one way through. `url`/`lineColour`/`valueLabel` describe a
  // single line — the area chart, which has only ever had one — and `sources`
  // describes a list of them, which is what the sensor panel needs to draw
  // temperature against PM2.5. Everything below the normalisation works on the
  // list, so there is no second code path to keep in step.
  //
  // A source is { url, label, colour, scale, unit, column, dash }. scale names
  // the y axis the line is measured against: two metrics in the same unit share
  // one, and µg/m³ against °C must not, or one of them is flattened into the
  // other's range. unit is what that axis's numbers are counted in — without it
  // a plot of two metrics shows two columns of bare numbers and leaves the
  // reader to guess which quantity each one belongs to.
  //
  // column names which array of its url's payload the line reads, defaulting to
  // "v". It is what lets one banded response draw three lines, and dash is how
  // those three are told apart: the sensor is solid, its surroundings dashed.
  //
  // metricLabel names the single line in the hover card; valueLabel is the unit there, so it is the fallback.
  //
  // fill sizes the plot to whatever height its container gives the frame, with no drag handle:
  // the sensor panel over the map hands the chart the room left after its header and gauges.
  //
  // resizable gives the plot a drag handle: analysing a day of four metrics
  // wants more than the 240px a summary chart needs.
